# Vehicle Builder

## Description

This project is designed to simulate picking and customizing vehicles and then preforming actions with them. Some of the various actions that can be preformed are starting, stopping, accelerating, decelerating, turning. Some vehicles also have bonus actions they can preform such as towing with some trucks and wheelie's with motorbikes. The application is completely text based and doesn't have any graphics but is a good example of how to build a larger scale project in typescript with multiple classes and interfaces.

- Selecting an existing vehicle instead will give you a list of vehicles to chose from. Once you scroll down to the one you want hit enter.
- After picking a vehicle you will also be taken to a list of actions to preform with the selected vehicle.
- In actions list there's also option to select or create another vehicle which will take you back to the beginning of the program again.
